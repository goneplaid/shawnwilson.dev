# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

This is a Nuxt 4 application. Use these commands for development:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server (http://localhost:3000)
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Preview production build
pnpm preview

# Generate static site
pnpm generate
```

## Project Architecture

### Framework Stack
- **Nuxt 4**: Main framework with Vue 3 and TypeScript
- **TailwindCSS 3**: Utility-first CSS framework with `@nuxtjs/tailwindcss` module (using v3 for compatibility)
- **Vue Router 4**: Client-side routing (handled by Nuxt)

### Project Structure
- `app/app.vue`: Main application entry point
- `app/assets/css/main.css`: Global CSS with Tailwind imports
- `nuxt.config.ts`: Nuxt configuration with CSS imports
- `tailwind.config.js`: Tailwind configuration (currently minimal)
- `public/`: Static assets served directly

### Key Configuration Notes
- TypeScript configuration extends `.nuxt/tsconfig.json` (auto-generated by Nuxt)
- TailwindCSS 3 is configured as a Nuxt module for compatibility with current library versions
- Devtools are enabled for development
- Uses ES modules (`"type": "module"` in package.json)

### Development Workflow
- Nuxt handles TypeScript compilation automatically
- TailwindCSS is processed through the Nuxt module
- Hot reload is available during development
- No additional linting or testing scripts are currently configured
